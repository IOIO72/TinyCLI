# TinyCLI / Bulletin-Board Edition

This website welcomes the user by a terminal interface - as you
experienced all ready.

**Why?**

... because I had much fun developing it and it's a kind of time machine
back to the times to 8 and 16 bit computing for geeks like me.

You can also take it as an unusual design approach for websites.

**How?**

I wrote this CLI by using ES6 and SCSS. If you are a developer you can
get more information in the GitHub repository of this project.

**Status**

The project is still work in progress and it runs best on Chrome.
There are still some essential things to do.
